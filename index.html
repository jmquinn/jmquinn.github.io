          <p>I began my career at Michigan State University after graduating from the MSU Lyman Briggs School with a degree in Human Biology and Computer Science. I was hired by the ACNS Storage Systems team after working as a student employee at the helpdesk, and my responsibilities grew and adapted with the organization as technology and resource consumption grew without restriction. I was initially responsible for supporting a single newly deployed 8 TB storage array, eventually taking on the entire organization’s 500 TB of enterprise storage. Then, I moved on to managing the team responsible for the enterprise’s central virtualization and storage services. In addition to taking on increased responsibilities when possible, I have filled many crucial roles over the course of my career at MSU. I developed change management software that allowed the organization to take its first steps towards IT Service Management principles, championed fiscal responsibility for services through researching, documenting, and presenting to leadership a cost-based case for service sustainability, and promoted data-driven decision making to reduce the financial impact of unrestricted data growth.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Management:</b><br />
            Merged and established a new culture of high performance, building a team comprised of full-time staff, contractors, and consultants to drive successful projects and initiatives that provide a robust and resilient infrastructure
            <br /><br />
            <b>Leadership:</b><br>
            Established cross-departmental relationships to champion organizational improvements including standard maintenance windows, service request and service lifecycle management, change management, and service TCO with show-back cost accounting
            <br /><br />
            <b>Technical Proficiency:</b><br>
            Detailed experience with storage, backup, and server technology standards, as well as a wide variety of programming and scripting languages
