          <p>
            I started my career at Michigan State University after graduating from the MSU Lyman Briggs School with a degree in Human Biology and Computer Science. After working at the help desk as a student troubleshooting faculty, staff, and student issues. My initial responsibilities within the storage systems team included administering enterprise storage arrays and Linux servers within the central academic-focused IT department on campus. Largely self-taught and self-motivated, I familiarized myself with the various systems and grew to become an expert in both fields.
            <br /><br />
            After a reorganization, I was promoted to manager of a newly created Virtualization, Storage and Systems team. My team was responsible for managing 14 VMWare clusters located in various datacenters across campus serving over 1300 virtual servers, managing 10 Enterprise-class storage arrays serving over 500 TB of data, a roughly 100 TB backup operation, and over 400 administered Windows and Linux servers that support systems such as our enterprise business applications: SAP, IBM Cognos, and Kuali Financial System.
            <br /><br />
            I stepped down from my management position for personal reasons, which allowed me to work remotely for a period of time as part of the Infrastructure Design team here I worked on service definitions, service level agreements, and funding and accounting models. I have since resumed working on-site, and continue to spearhead and complete many of the projects I started as a manager, as well as taking on new roles to further the mission of the organization.
            <br /><br />
            I am currently the acting manager of my previous team, put back into the role after a significant outage affected the university’s most critical systems during finals. While the acting manager, I have successfully completed one of the most ambitious and visible projects the central IT department has seen, to resolve the decade of accrued technical debt. All major milestones were met, and after 10 months and roughly 10 million dollars, I helped architect and lead the team that built the most resilient infrastructure the university had ever seen, reducing the recovery time from more than 5 weeks to 6 hours.
            <br /><br />
            My next endeavors are to expand my team to deploy a scalable, self-sustaining virtual desktop offering, redesigning and deploying a new backup architecture to better protect the university’s most critical and valuable data against disasters, and to work on plans to transition to both a hybrid cloud and new on premise data center.
